Theses are my first websites!
This repository is a bit of a mess right now but I promise I'll get it sorted at some point!

Meanwhile you can checkout all my codewars solutions [here](https://github.com/tyc45/web-projects/blob/main/test-site/scripts/codewars-solutions.js)

Right now I'm working on a small website project for my band, Low Ceiling, mainly for the sake of practicing teamwork
