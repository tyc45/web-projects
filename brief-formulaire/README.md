Welcome to my first brief for the Web Developper class at Simplon.co

This is a basic form using only HTML for the sake of exercising the basics of HTML syntax and structuring.

This was made in the context of a brief that asked me to deliver a proper form using only HTML.
I was asked to make sure all fields would only register the correct inputs and to respect coding good practices as much as I could.

Making this, I learned some of the basic HTML syntax and how to use parameters.

Any comment on anything you see here is welcome! :D
